4. Add a quick reflection(2 sentences) about what was difficult __Place on Readme__

   Catching up to the rest of the class was difficult, since my computer froze for a bit and I wasn't able to find out how to add the sound in whenever the cookie was clicked.
   I also thought the counter was a little tricky to figure out, but it made sense once I knew how to do it.
